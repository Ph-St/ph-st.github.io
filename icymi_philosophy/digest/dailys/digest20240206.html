Suffering as a proxy for Evil misses the point. Even as someone non-religious like me (I'm not a big fan of words like atheism and agnosticism that don't capture my thoughts), I won't leave a good word like "Evil" on the table to be used only by deists. I see "Evil" as meaning "profound harm" that goes beyond incidental, casual, or occasional badness.</p><p>Genocide, for example, is necessary to describe as evil. A word like "bad" doesn't begin to get close.  Calling someone a bad name might be bad, but is not intrinsically evil in and of itself.</p><p>But even taking this discussion on its own terms, there is a presumption in here about a God who takes an interest at all. Other possible models of God, if there is one, are the Indifferent God, who created the world and then lost interest and may or may not even check in. I sometimes model this like an ant farm, except I don't find it reasonable for a completely different reason than any discussed: Why would there be so much clutter all about that is not the ant farm. If you were going to make an ant farm, would you really make it full of sand miles high and miles wide just to have ants in the very center couple of centimeters? Why make it so hard to find?</p><p>By the way, I discussed the ant farm model in my long-ago blog post "Hawking God", which this discussion here somewhat builds on. (<a href="http://netsettlement.blogspot.com/2010/09/hawking-god.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="ellipsis">netsettlement.blogspot.com/201</span><span class="invisible">0/09/hawking-god.html</span></a>)</p><p>I suppose you could make an argument for an Experimenter God, who created a gazillion worlds on a theory that only one in a gazillion would evolve life at all, and not knowing what conditions would do it, that God just figured a sufficiently random set of variations would find out probabilistically. (There's some issue here about how a success would be reported back.  Maybe it doesn't count as a success if it doesn't evolve high enough to report back, and maybe we're about to be one of the failures.)</p><p>But then there's also the Trivially True God. This confuses most people conversationally but seems a necessary thing. Suppose I just say that what i mean by God is that "our universe exists", an act that inevitably happened outside our Universe, since nothing in the Universe is powerful enough to cause that. That says nothing about whether such a God is big or small, sentient or not sentient, aware of us or not. It just intends to say "there is at least one fact of any kind that we do not know but have some rational evidence to believe exists outside of our realm in a way that is intrinsically not knowable even though its existence is knowable: how the Universe came to be".  There's good reason to believe that such a fact exists. We try to find evidence from within, but there's no guarantee that's possible. We just don't have anything else to try. I sometimes think of that as "God". But that doesn't imply any of the things commonly associated with god: interest, involvement, power, intelligence, moral judgment. It merely implies some agency, entity, situation, phenomenon, accident, or other entity of a kind we can't even perceive that is not of our universe but is sufficient to create our universe. </p><p>Even the Trivially True God theory leaves us with a puzzle that seems without resolution even as it's clear it must have one: How/where did the situation allowing that situation come into being. Anthropomorphizing in a wildly inappropriate way that undoes a lot of my careful qualification: how did god get created? The idea that e created eirself is not at all satisfactory in my book, though is a popular deus ex machina -- er, well, not ending but beginning -- ok, maybe both.</p><p>I STILL have not read Steven Hawking's book, though I have always understood his belief was that to make the reflective tower converge, god must be smaller, not larger, so that eventually, perhaps even by infinite series, it converges. </p><p>An infinite series getting smaller doesn't totally satisfy me. But it makes the puzzle more compact. It reduces it to something like "In the beginning there was a possibility". Maybe it was possible to have the possibility go both ways, so that there is both a universe and antiuniverse (not an antimatter universe, but an absence of universe, the other half of the possibility of one at all) that somehow balance, such that there is really never was a universe. That's still unsatisfactory, but it's less unsatisfactory than some other accounts.</p><p>Soon enough we'll all be gone. At that point, were we ever here? We imagine we think therefore we are, but when there is no one to think, were we ever? Sounds crazy, but yet, the fundamental asymmetry of existence is the real puzzle. It's good to retain an open mind, while we have minds at all. The Existence Asymmetry problem is the only really interesting God-related question, in my opinion. Good &amp; Evil matter to us, but not to the Universe.</p><p><a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Philosophy" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Philosophy</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/evil" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>evil</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/philosophyBites" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>philosophyBites</span></a></p></div>
