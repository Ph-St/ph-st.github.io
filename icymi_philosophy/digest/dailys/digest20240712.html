<div class="content"><p>I have issues with all the discussion over Biden. People seem to be talking at crossed purposes. I think some are not listening to what others are saying. That's super disrespectful, but also HUGELY unproductive because there's no point arguing against something no one is saying.</p><p>For example, some are seeing this as pro-Biden vs anti-Biden. That's a huge misunderstanding. The ones asking Biden to step aside are ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY people who like and respect Biden. They're NOT "against" him. They're interested in seeing Dems win, and they don't think Biden can.</p><p>I'm going to refer instead to Stayers and Steppers. Stayers are those who think Biden should stay, and Steppers are those who think Biden should step aside. I conjured these words so they don't have pre-attached senses of Good vs Bad. They're just people divided by their preferred tactic for winning the election.</p><p>It comes up in Biden v Trump discussions that folks say to vote Biden because he's not an autocrat. I also hear some Stayers saying that Steppers should stop talking about forcing a candidate on voters that they didn't vote for, that that's autocratic. It's not autocratic. The process is messy, but it's not autocratic. </p><p>Many of us have used terms like fascist and autocrat loosely for our whole lives because we never needed the terms to refer to our reality. We now risk seeing these played out in horrifying reality, so let's be more careful with words.</p><p>I DO who takes over and why is important, though. Kamala's whole job is to be the backup for Biden. So she's the obvious choice. I agree opening the convention to a fight among other candidates will create both chaos and resentment. Skipping a well-qualified woman of color will be conspicuous. Let's not do that. But, either way, it's not autocratic.</p><p>There ARE people who don't like Biden in this, and might even be described as anti-Biden, but that group is NOT the Steppers. I'll call the third group the Disillusioned.</p><p>Some Disillusioned are just shrugging quietly, some are actively bitter. This group either won't vote  or will vote third party. The Disillusioned are NOT Steppers. They don't CARE any more what Biden does, because they've washed their hands of it.</p><p>The fact that there exists a Disillusioned group is the primary reason, I think, that Biden's numbers are suffering. He was suffering even before the debate. But the debate gave us a reason to talk about Biden's poll numbers. The Steppers are worried about how many Disillusioned there are. In many cases, they've talked to the Disillusioned to try to get them to come back, to explain how important it is to back the Dems. That discussion usually goes nowhere and is painful. For the Stayers not to acknowledge that the Steppers have made such good faith arguments to the Disillusioned that the Stayers have pointlessly made to the Steppers (because the Steppers are not the ones walking away, they are just remarking on the fact of others doing it) is SUPER-annoying and incredibly disrespectful and unproductive.</p><p>People have become disillusioned for may reasons, but Gaza is a big one. No amount of saying the war should finally end is going to get them back. They're mad about the GENOCIDE, and they're hearing "it's time to end this" as "our genocide has killed as many as is productive". That doesn't appease them. They need an admission that a VERY BAD thing is already done and still ongoing and we've supported that. They think someone must take blame. It's hard to see the Disillusioned-by-Gaza coming back at all, but if they do they'll want Biden, who made us complicit, gone. For that reason alone, Biden CANNOT heal this by staying.</p><p>Some Disillusioned are also worried about age. Some may have seen someone among family or friends go downhill. They know how quickly it can happen. They know it doesn't happen all at once, but at first it's "now and then". No amount of showing a good day will convince them there aren't bad days. That's going to still haunt them. To them, Biden's reassurances sound like a promise of a brave face that may hide a hidden truth.</p><p>Plus, defense of Biden's gaffes gives cover to Trump's.</p><p>Some Disillusioned just don't want a choice of two old white guys. That's only fixed by Biden stepping aside.</p><p>Biden and the Stayers keep showing us people who like him, but no Stepper doubts there are such people so that helps not at all. </p><p>The Stayers point to good days, but no amount of good days rebut the possibility of bad days. </p><p>The Stayers point to past accomplishments, but no past accomplishment is proof of a future one. </p><p>A lot of pointless, wasted talk at crossed purposes.</p><p>The Steppers aren't the ones walking away. They're just observing that OTHERS are.</p><p>Tonight's press conference did not speak to those others.</p><p>- - - - -<br>I wanted to refer to logical proof rules for universal and existential quantifications, but I went for less nerdy English instead, hoping to be more accessible to all.</p><p><a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Biden" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Biden</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Kamala" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Kamala</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Election2024" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Election2024</span></a></p></div>
