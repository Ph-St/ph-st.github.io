<div class="content"><p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@screwtape" class="u-url mention" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@<span>screwtape</span></a></span> </p><p>You also had mentioned the original CLTL book and wondered if it was an ANSI standard. It was not. It was a "de facto standard", that is, it was just a popular book. But it was designed by a committee with purpose. The so-called "gang of 5" who put most of it together, with Guy Steele at the helm, allowed a number of others (eventually myself included, though I joined after it began, as told in my Untold Story paper and as you related on your show).  It was after we (meaning Steele) published CLTL that we realized we had no process for evolving things and we turned to ANSI to help us make an actual standard.</p><p>There was a CLTL2, but it was (by its own admission, somewhere in the roman-numeraled front matter) not a committee work, not proofread by the committee and not even consistent with the final standard. It was Steele's snapshot of work in progress. It was important in its time as a bridge and approximate view of what might come, but it is also probably responsible for the confusion that the 1994 output was a aecond standard. It was a second official language revision, but more like an unintentional competitor with ANSI standard. No one minded Steele doing this, but it created some conceptual confusion.</p><p>So the 1994 thing was the first and only ANSI standard. It had many drafts leading up to the final work, all of which were labeled dpANS something, meaning "draft proposed American National Standard". The final work, in 1994, was an "ANS" (American National Standard).</p><p>Also, the dpANS sources are effectively (see Untold Story for better detail on what "effectively" means) public, while the actual standard is (narrowly) controlled by ANSI. It's a distinction without a difference, though, because the body content of both documents is the same. They differ only in frontmatter and headings. But as a legal matter, there are some issues. I did get permission from ANSI to make the HyperSpec be a derivative of the actual standard but most public documents base themselves on the final dpANS to avoid the need for such permission.</p><p>You also describe me as a leader, and I think that's fair, but it's important to say that it was a group effort of many people (see the credits for a sense of the complexity of contributions <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Body/00_.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">http://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">lispworks.com/documentation/lw</span><span class="invisible">50/CLHS/Body/00_.htm</span></a>).</p><p>But I was the second of two editors. Kathy Chapman, of Digital Equipment Corporation, was not a Lisp programmer, but she did an able job of taking Steele's CLTL and putting it in a format more like a standard. Even before taking over from her, I contributed a lot of what became a 60-page glossary, but she laid out a lot of the structure and doesn't get enough credit. Also, the administrative process of voting and meetings was run by Guy Steele and there were several committee heads that did parts of the language. My job, as Project Editor, was to consolidate a lot of that and distill it into a document that was coherent and complete, though it was so large that I worried for a long time that we were leaving something out. </p><p>In 1984, by coincidence, I had written an early Hypertext editor. I didn't know what hypertext was, I had to learn that word later. But I wrote it up here: ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-829.pdf just in case anyone is curious.</p><p>Periodically, people would ask me what some tables in the hardcopy were doing and I would say they were important as hyperlinks, which probably made no sense to anyone back then, and I only meant it metaphorically at the time, but later it was super-cool when I finally wrote the Common Lisp program that turned the TeX sources into HTML for the Common Lisp HyperSpec, after completing the standard, when the list of 978 symbols lit up with hyperlinks for every one of them, confirming that I'd actually documented all the things I claimed to have.</p><p>I had a role in the condition system and in a lot of the cleanup items, but it's really important not to make it look like it was my thing alone.  I really loved how collaborative it was, and people like Steele, Gabriel, Masinter, Fahlman, Loosemore, and others too numerous to mention here were really key, too.</p><p>In fact, for many reasons I did not tell stories of a  lot of things because I felt they were not my stories to tell. I am vocal about a lot of this, so I get a lot of attention, but I've found over time that some people are writers and/or storytellers and some are not. And I worried these stories would not be told at all. So at some risk of getting more credit than due, I tell many of these stories. But I hope in the process not to eclipse those who made quieter contributions.</p><p>I've been fortunate enough to get to contribute in various ways, but even more fortunate in being in the right place at the right time to know a lot of amazing people, both personally and indirectly through their organizational and personal contributions.</p><p><a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/lisp" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>lisp</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/CommonLisp" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>CommonLisp</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/LispyGopher" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>LispyGopher</span></a></p></div>

You described it as somehow related to Fortran. Maybe, but that's not my memory. Algol is from the same era as Fortran, or close to, but is distinct. Algol doesn't seem Fortran-like to me, and Wikipedia doesn't cite Fortran as a special influence. It was a nicely block-structured language with lexical scoping, and Scheme is directly inspired by it in its push for lexical scoping, which (oddly) was very controversial in the Lisp community elsewhere until Common Lisp.  </p><p>We (computer people of the era generally) used to call any block-structured language an Algol-like language until people forgot what Algol was.  I think for a while people referred to Pascal too, which came later. But now they attribute to C or Java, probably, as if those invented block structure.</p><p>In fact, if you look at the Algol paper and the early RRRS papers, you'll see an attempt to mirror it, with reverent precision, down to the typography. See both the typography and the dedication on page 1 here in R3RS: <a href="https://standards.scheme.org/official/r3rs.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">standards.scheme.org/official/</span><span class="invisible">r3rs.pdf</span></a><br>Compare to Algol 60 report in both style, down to the fact of a dedication:<br><a href="https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/report/Algol60_report_CACM_1960_June.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">softwarepreservation.org/proje</span><span class="invisible">cts/ALGOL/report/Algol60_report_CACM_1960_June.pdf</span></a></p><p><a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Lisp" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Lisp</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Scheme" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Scheme</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/Algol" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>Algol</span></a> <a href="https://climatejustice.social/tags/LispyGopher" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#<span>LispyGopher</span></a></p></div>
